# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Apache-Storm-and-Apache-Kafka

In this project a real time streaming and processing engine is developed using Kafka and storm. Through Kafka we read the tweets and then use a JSON parser to clean data and provide it to Apache storm for sentiment analysis and results i.e. the class is stored in HDFS and reported using NodeJS
